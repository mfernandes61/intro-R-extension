## These materials are to extend our "Introduction to R" course. It is envisioned that they will be used:

* As extra materials by more advanced pupils to keep them challenged during course.   
* Provide more practice for students in between sessions when the course is taught as 4 half-day sessions.
* Provide a means for students to test their comprehension of taught material or a refresher (post-course).
